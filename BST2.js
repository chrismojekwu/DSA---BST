/* 

Trees are data structuresd that consist of nodes which are linked together
in a certain way. The nodes in the tree have a parent-child relaitonship.

Binary trees are trees in which nodes can only have 0, 1 , or 2 children. A branch
signifies a path that connects 1 node to each other. Binary trees have a left 
and right branch. 

A subtree is a mini tree within a binary tree whose roote can be 
any node and all of its descendants rooted at that node.

Binary search tree gaurentee that all of the nodes in the left hand branch of a nodde
are gauranteed to have lower values than the node itself. All of the nodes in the right
hand branch are gauranteed to have a higher value than the node itself.
